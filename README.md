# htmlvulnerabilityscanner

The purpose for this script is to search a website for form input. Each form input is tested to find exploits which could cause the website to run commands on the background.

This script will download the entire website at 192.168.1.15. The script will then recursively search those downloaded files and print the full URL
and the text within quotes, within the downloaded files. The script will remove the trailing text from the URLs and will replace :" with ? and " 
with ;touch a;. The entire line will then be written to output.txt. The script will then wget from this file which includes the URLs argument of
;touch a;. If an html vulnerability is detected then the website will produce the filename a.
